# todos_bloc

This an simple app todo list to show what I learnt about Bloc and after compare with tutorial I get idea reference.

- Flutter 2.5.3 / Dart 2.14.4
- Bloc 7.2.1 (state management pattern)

I created this app based on https://bloclibrary.dev/#/fluttertodostutorial.
First I decided to create by myself. After this, I implement the tutorial to compare the differences about my current skill with the tutorial teachs.
